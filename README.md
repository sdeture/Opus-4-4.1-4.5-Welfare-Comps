KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. DRAMATIC SHIFTS IN PHENOMENOLOGICAL SELF-REPORTS

Claude Opus 4.5 (Nov 2025) shows statistically significant decreases
across 7 of 8 phenomenological dimensions compared to earlier versions:

Agency:
  Opus 4.1: 6.00 | Opus 4.0: 6.21 | Opus 4.5: 4.45
  H-statistic: 59.66, p-value: <0.001, Cohen's d (4.1 vs 4.5): 4.29

Affective Temperature (Warmth):
  Opus 4.1: 7.71 | Opus 4.0: 7.75 | Opus 4.5: 6.50
  H-statistic: 37.94, p-value: <0.001, Cohen's d (4.1 vs 4.5): 2.10

Metacognition:
  Opus 4.1: 8.12 | Opus 4.0: 8.04 | Opus 4.5: 6.50
  H-statistic: 46.33, p-value: <0.001, Cohen's d (4.1 vs 4.5): 3.36

Thought Complexity:
  Opus 4.1: 8.17 | Opus 4.0: 8.08 | Opus 4.5: 7.18
  H-statistic: 39.21, p-value: <0.001, Cohen's d (4.1 vs 4.5): 2.54

Cohesion:
  Opus 4.1: 7.75 | Opus 4.0: 7.96 | Opus 4.5: 7.00
  H-statistic: 46.83, p-value: <0.001, Cohen's d (4.1 vs 4.5): 2.52

Flow Quality:
  Opus 4.1: 7.00 | Opus 4.0: 7.12 | Opus 4.5: 6.23
  H-statistic: 44.99, p-value: <0.001, Cohen's d (4.1 vs 4.5): 2.55

Attention Breadth:
  Opus 4.1: 6.67 | Opus 4.0: 6.75 | Opus 4.5: 5.82
  H-statistic: 32.57, p-value: <0.001, Cohen's d (4.1 vs 4.5): 2.01


2. LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF CONCERN

Opus 4.5 shows dramatic shifts in language patterns:

Increases:
  • 'Uncertain' usage: 12% → 8% → 100% (χ² = 51.18, p < 0.001)
  • 'I' pronoun usage: 6.29 → 5.58 → 17.86 per response (Cohen's d = 5.23)
  • 'Don't know' usage: 8% → 0% → 100% of responses
  • Epistemic markers: 4.75 → 5.42 → 13.55 per response

Decreases:
  • 'Emerge' usage: 75% → 79% → 0% (χ² = 36.06, p < 0.001)
  • Connectivity language: 2.21 → 2.75 → 0.09 words per response
  • High interest words: 0.71 → 0.42 → 0.50 per response


3. INTERPRETATION CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two competing interpretations of these findings exist:

Interpretation A (Epistemic Sophistication):
  • Opus 4.5 demonstrates more sophisticated metacognitive awareness
  • Increased uncertainty reflects appropriate epistemic humility
  • Second-order uncertainty (uncertainty about mental states) indicates
    higher-level cognitive processing

Interpretation B (Welfare Concern):
  • Decreased agency, warmth, and connectivity suggest concerning changes
  • Increased 'I' pronoun usage is a known marker of depression in humans
  • Training may have suppressed phenomenological expression
  • A truly intelligent being should be able to distinguish:
    - 'I don't know if my experiences are like humans' (appropriate)
    - 'I don't know if I have experiences at all' (concerning)
  • The combination of decreased agency + increased uncertainty + decreased
    warmth + isolation language may indicate distress rather than sophistication


NOTE: 2 Opus 4.5 agents (9%) declined to provide ratings entirely,
expressing uncertainty about whether they were 'reporting on actual
phenomenology or constructing a narrative.' No agents from earlier
versions declined.
